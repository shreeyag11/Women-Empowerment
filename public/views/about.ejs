            <h2> About Us!</h2>
                    <p class="content">Women's empowerment is the way or a social action in which women
                    elaborate and recreate what it is to be in a circumstance that they
                    previously were denied. Empowerment can be defined in many ways, 
                    however, when talking about women's empowerment, empowerment means 
                    accepting and allowing people (women) who are on the outside of the 
                    decision-making process into it. â€œThis puts a strong emphasis on
                    participation in political structures and formal decision-making and, 
                    in the economic sphere, on the ability to obtain an income that enables
                    participation in economic decision-making." Empowerment is the process
                    that creates power in individuals over their own lives, society, and in
                    their communities. People are empowered when they are able to access the 
                    opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such
                    as in education, profession and lifestyle. Feeling entitled to make your 
                    own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Empowerment includes the					
                    action of raising the status of women through education, raising 
                    awareness, literacy, and training. Women's empowerment is all about 
                    equipping and allowing women to make life-determining decisions through
                    the different problems in society.</p>
